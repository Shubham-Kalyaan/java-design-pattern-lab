## Observer Design Pattern

---
The Observer Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many dependency between objects. When the state of one object (the subject) changes, all its dependents (observers) are notified and updated automatically. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where a change in one object needs to be reflected in multiple other objects without tightly coupling them.
